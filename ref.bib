	abstract = {Following Prof. Mark Harman of Facebook's keynote and formal presentations (which are recorded in the proceed- ings) there was a wide ranging discussion at the eighth inter- national Genetic Improvement workshop, GI-2020 @ ICSE (held as part of the International Conference on Software En- gineering on Friday 3rd July 2020). Topics included industry take up, human factors, explainabiloity (explainability, jus- tifyability, exploitability) and GI benchmarks. We also con- trast various recent online approaches (e.g. SBST 2020) to holding virtual computer science conferences and workshops via the WWW on the Internet without face to face interac- tion. Finally we speculate on how the Coronavirus Covid-19 Pandemic will a ect research next year and into the future.},

	abstract = {While dependency analysis is foundational to much program analysis, many techniques have limited scalability and handle only monolingual systems. We present a novel dependency analysis technique that aims to approximate program dependency from a relatively small number of perturbed executions. Our technique, MOAD (Modeling Observation-based Approximate Dependency), reformulates program dependency as the likelihood that one program element is dependent on another (instead of a Boolean relationship). MOAD generates program variants by deleting parts of the source code and executing them while observing the impact. MOAD thus infers a model of program dependency that captures the relationship between the modification and observation points. We evaluate MOAD using program slices obtained from the resulting probabilistic dependency models. Compared to the existing observation-based backward slicing technique, ORBS, MOAD requires only 18.6% of the observations, while the resulting slices are only 12% larger on average. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of the observation-based forward slices. Unlike ORBS, which inherently computes backward slices, MOAD's model's dependences can be traversed in either direction allowing us to easily compute forward slices. In comparison to the static forward slice, MOAD only misses deleting 0--6 lines (median 0), while excessively deleting 0--37 lines (median 8) from the slice.},

	abstract = {Observation Based Slicing is a program slicing technique that depends purely on the observation of dynamic program behaviours. It iteratively applies a deletion operator to the source code, and accepts the deletion (i.e. slices the program) if the program is observed to behave in the same was as the original with respect to the slicing criterion. While the original observation based slicing only used a single deletion operator based on deletion window, the catalogue of applicable deletion operators grew recently with the addition of deletion operators based on lexical similarity. We apply a hyperheuristic approach to the problem of selecting the best deletion operator to each program line. Empirical evaluation using four slicing criteria from Guava shows that the Hyperheuristic Observation Based Slicing (HOBBES) can significantly improve the effeciency of observation based slicing.},

	abstract = {Complex dependence analysis typically provides an underpinning approximation of true program dependence. We investigate the effectiveness of using lexical information to approximate such dependence, introducing two new deletion operators to Observation-Based Slicing (ORBS). ORBS provides direct observation of program dependence, computing a slice using iterative, speculative deletion of program parts. Deletions become permanent if they do not affect the slicing criterion. The original ORBS uses a bounded deletion window operator that attempts to delete consecutive lines together. Our new deletion operators attempt to delete multiple, non-contiguous lines that are lexically similar to each other. We evaluate the lexical dependence approximation by exploring the trade-off between the precision and the speed of dependence analysis performed with new deletion operators. The deletion operators are evaluated independently, as well as collectively via a novel generalization of ORBS that exploits multiple deletion operators: Multi-operator Observation-Based Slicing (MOBS). An empirical evaluation using three Java projects, six C projects, and one multi-lingual project written in Python and C finds that the lexical information provides a useful approximation to the underlying dependence. On average, MOBS can delete 69% of lines deleted by the original ORBS, while taking only 36% of the wall clock time required by ORBS.},

	abstract = {Program dependence is a fundamental concept to many software engineering tasks, yet the traditional dependence analysis struggles to cope with common modern development practices such as multi-lingual implementations and use of third-party libraries. While Observation-based Slicing (ORBS) solves these issues and produces an accurate slice, it has a scalability problem due to the need to build and execute the target program multiple times. We would like to propose a radical change of perspective: a useful dependence analysis needs to be scalable even if it approximates the dependency. Our goal is a scalable approximate program dependence analysis via estimating the likelihood of dependence. We claim that 1) using external information such as lexical analysis or a development history, 2) learning dependence model from partial observations, and 3) merging static, and observation-based approach would assist the proposition. We expect that our technique would introduce a new perspective of program dependence analysis into the likelihood of dependence. It would also broaden the capability of the dependence analysis towards large and complex software.},
